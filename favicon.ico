# Dylan’s Digital Toolbox 🛠️

Welcome to my personal learning project!  
**Dylan’s Digital Toolbox** is a collection of simple, practical web tools I built to sharpen my skills in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

This project was designed to help me:
- Practice clean code structure
- Strengthen my front-end development skills
- Learn how to deploy live sites with GitHub Pages
- Focus on UX with polish like dark mode and transitions

## 📚 **Why I Built This**
To create a project that grows as I grow.  
This toolbox started small but will expand as I learn new skills and techniques.  
It’s not about complexity — it’s about clean execution and progress.

## ⚡ **Future Plans**
- Add persistent storage (using `localStorage`) for Task Tracker
- Add more tools (stopwatch, calculator, etc.)
- Continue refining visuals and UX
- Possibly refactor with frameworks down the road
